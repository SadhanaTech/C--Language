Create "Library" project
------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to use TYPES from one app to another app, we must have to create that first "app" as library (dll) assembly.


Step-1: Create "ConsoleApp" 
Step-2: File + Add + New + Library project (say MyLib)
        In "MyLib" add TYPE def:

namespace Ashish
{
    public class Emp
    {
    }
    class Salary { }
}

Step-3: Build both apps (Build Solution)

Step-4: Right mouse click at "References" on "consoleApp" 
       + Add references 
       + Click on "Solutions" (a dialog box with assemblies)
       + [x] MyLib + OK

  [Note: If the assembly you wish to use in your program is not
         exists into solution then click on "Browse" button to
         select it from your disk.]
