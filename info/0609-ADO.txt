  Microsoft SQL Server Version 2012
  ---------------------------------

  MSSQL Server database has different editions including:

    1. Standard (Commercial) 
    2. Enterprize (Commercial) and
    3. Express (Free for developers)


  When we install the VS, MSSQL Server Express edition will be
  installed and we can use VS to design the database (create   table,views, stored proc etc).

  MSSQL Server Express edition has all these abilities and features exists with Standard and Enterprize except it has
  single user experience. It means you cannot use express databases outside your installation machine.

  MSSQL Server - Authentication & Authorization
  ----------------------------------------------
  There are two authentication modes:

   1. Windows Authentication - Windows OS user's credentails
			       are used to logged the SQL Server.

   2. SQL Server Authentication - Separate userid and password
				required to connect the database.

   [Express Edition support Win Authentication only].

  MSSQL Server databases
  -----------------------
  With Express edition, you can create two types of databases (However there isn't any difference):

   1. Remote Database - They are stored into MSSQL Server's HOME
			(centralize repository) and shared
			by one or more applications.
   2. Local Database  - They are stored/created into the project
			and they are used by the current app.
                        This type of database is only used for
			application development. In production,
			we must have to create "remote" database.


 MSSQL Server Instances
 -----------------------
 Each installation of MSSQL product requires a unique instance- name (servername).

 For example, Express installation uses (LocalDB)\V11.0

 1. Open VS + 2. View Menu  3. SQL Server Object Explorer
 4. Right click on server node + Add SQL Server instance

 
try(Connection cn = DriverManager.getConnection("")) {

}catch(Exception ex) {

}

Object must be java.lang.AutoCloseable
