Web Platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 It is small framework sits upon the existing frameworks (top-level)
 to develop, and execute programs.

 In the area of web, we have web-client platform (Web-bRowser) and
 web-server platform (.net framework/asp.net).


 Web-clients platforms can be web-browser, or your custom programs  which request the web-resources which are placed at "web-server  platform".


 Web-browser
 ----------
 It is the complex software in your system. It does:

   => Request the resources. Browser creates an envelop to send 	instructions (called request header) and data (request body). 
   => It receive data & instructions ( resource header and response 	body).

   => It parse response data(body) as per response header(instructions)

   => It generate Document Object Model - DOM tree. Create DOM (an      object) of each HTML and Text and place it to DOM tree.

   => CSS Modules (color, image, animation, text,sound etc) are used
      to assign CSS properties to DOMs.

   => JavaScript language and JavaScript runtime execute JavaScript 
      code.
   => Graphics Engine paint the content on browser-window as per DOM-      tree.
   => Authering tool to create or deploy Add-ons/plug-ins .
  
   => Provide debugging tools - i.e Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I -        Moz/Chrome)



How web communication works?
-----------------------------

 
 | WebBrowsers |
 | (clients)   |=====> Request web-resources  ====> | HTTP or Web
 | or custom   |       located at HTTP server       | Server
 | programs    |                                    | (apache, IIS
                <==== Response <========            ----------------

					|Application Server 
					| (.NET/Java/PHP etc)
                                        |-----------------------------
                                        | Process the client's request
					| and produce 					| HTML/CSS/JavaScript or 
					| XML/JSON data and forward
					| them to web-server
                                        ------------------------------
                                          |         |        | 
                                       Database    Mail     Other
                                        Server       Server  Server



Web-Server : Main job of web-server is to listen clients. Resolve resource requests and forward resource requests to application server if resource-type is "dynamic". In case of 'static' resource, the web-server creates a copy of that resource and forward it (copied resource) to web-browser.

  Apache, Internet Information Service (IIS) are example of web-server.   Note that web-server cannot execute any resource requests except they
  makes copy of 'static' resource.

 
Web Resources
-------------

  .html, .css, .js, image files, video/audio files are example of   'static' resources.

  Programs written in C#/Java/PHP are example of dynamic resources.


Install the IIS
=================================

1. Control Panel + Programs & Features + Turn on/off    windows components. 

2. Select [x] Internet Information Services
              [x] IIS6 compatibiity
                 [x] Web component
                      [x] ASP.NET 4.5
                      [x] ASP.NET 3.5
3. OK 
    


HTML
===================================================

HTML is a standard to present data on the web. Currently we've HTML4 and HTML5 standard (HTML5 is partially implemented by browser vendors and developers).


HTML TAGS
-----------

1. directive <!doctype html>  

   <!doctype html> is a new way to tells/instructs the
   web-browser to create DOMs and render them using
   "standard mode".
   If <!doctype html> is missed then web-browser will
   entered into "Quirk/dirty mode" and its render-engine will surprise you with different rendering behaviors.

2. Semantic HTML Tags

    <div class="chapter-container">
      
      <div class="chapter-title">Chapter-1</div>
       
      <div class="chapter-body">
         details descirption of chapter-1

         
         <div class="chapter-footer">
              * condition applied
         </div>
      </div>
      ......
      
   </div>
         

HTML5 Sematics tags

 <section>
     <article>  
        <header>Chapter-1</header>
         <div class="chapter-content">
             details descirption of chapter-1
             <div class="author-address">

             </div>
         </div>
         <footer>
              * condition applied
         </footer>
      </article>
      ......
      
   </section>
