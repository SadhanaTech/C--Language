C# Language  (Version 5.0 or .net framework version)
===================================================


 [C# in Depth is the best book to learn .net framework]

 C# Language is,

     1. Statically typed (or strongly type) language
     2. C# supports object-oriented paradigm
     3. C# supports dynamic language features
     4. C# language is developed using C# Language Specification.
     5. C# is case-sensitive and its syntax derived from C++ lang.
     6. CSharp - Sharpness of C++ and easyness of VB 6.
     7. There isn't any datatype exists with C# so we must have
        to use the CTS.
     8. C# code stored into a file called "compilation unit" and you
        can choose any file name and extension however .cs is commonly         used extension.

     C# is the only language available to all version of .net      framework. 


    Statically or strongly typed : The type of "value" and "variable"     will be examined at the time of compilation to avoid runtime     errors.  
  
             e.g   float no = 10.10; <-- value type of double (8 bytes)
                         ^
                         |__ var type is "float" 

                   [Above statement throws an error due to type                      mismatch at the time of compilation]

Console Application Project Template
===================================================================


  To learn C# & .net framework from the scratch, the VS introduce a simple yet powerful project (program) template which allow us to write and debug code without adding heavy user-interfaces.


  The input and output of "Console Application" are bounded with   command prompt or terminal and the class called "System.Console" is
  used to read & write data from/into terminal(command prompt).



  What is "project template"?

      Project Template is nothing but XML document contains compilation       parameters, library references, resources & their location and
      so on. Lately this XML document is used by "build tool (msbuild)"       to produce the assembly.

      The VS offers number of "project templates", each with different
      amount of files, lib references, resources and build       configurations to save the developer effort on building &       debugging apps.
  

       When you create a project (using any project template), there will be a file whose extension is .csproj (or in VB it is .vbproj), it is an XML document which is used by build tool.


       There will be .sln file exists under your project file which
       is used to add reference of other projects opened in current
       IDE. In fact solution explorer shows projects added as a "group" and project groun information is saved into .sln (solution file).

        Important: Do not change .csproj manually. It it is corrupt                    then you can't your project anymore.

                   You can delete .sln file because if it is not there
                   then VS will create a fresh one. So .sln is not
                   a part of your project but be careful with .csproj
                   file.
